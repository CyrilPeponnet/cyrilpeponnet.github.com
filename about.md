Hey !

I am a software engineer at [Nuage Networks](http://www.nuagenetworks.net) in Moutain View, California.

I always been fascinated by technology especially low level computer engineering and automation.
My natural curiosity leads me to analyze deeply how things work especially in a world of Internet of things where virtualization/automation came at the first place in scalable cloud design.


Previously I've been working during 7 years as a Linux System Engineer for a French car manufacturer, Iâ€™ve been in charge of several main project from embedded systems to datacenter virtualization. This brought me an appropriate mindset in architecture design.


With this blog, based on [Lanyon](http://lanyon.getpoole.com) built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com) I will try share some expertise and pet projects.


Happy reading!
